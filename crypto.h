/** Encrypt a given plaintext using the Caesar cipher, using a specified key, where the
  * characters to encrypt fall within a given range (and all other characters are copied
  * over unchanged).
  *
  * Each character in `plain_text` is examined to see if it falls with the range specified
  * by `range_low` and `range_high`, and a corresponding character is then written to the
  * same position in `cipher_text`. If the `plain_text` character is outside the range,
  * then the corresponding character is not encrypted: exactly the same character should
  * be written to exactly the same position in `cipher_text`. If the `plain_text`
  * character is within the range, it should be encrypted using the Caesar cipher:  
  * a new character is obtained by shifting it by `key` positions (modulo the size of the
  * range).
  *
  * For decryption, use a negative key value or use the `caesar_decrypt` function with the
  * same key value.
  *
  *
  * ## Example usage
  *
  *
  *
  * ```c
  *   char plain_text[] = "HELLOWORLD";
  *   char cipher_text[sizeof(plain_text)] = {0};
  *   caesar_encrypt('A', 'Z', 3, plain_text, cipher_text);
  *   // After the function call, cipher_text will contain the encrypted text
  *   char expected_cipher_text = "KHOORZRUOG"
  *   assert(strcmp(cipher_text, expected_cipher_text) == 0);
  * ```
  *
  * \param range_low A character representing the lower bound of the character range to be
  *           encrypted
  * \param range_high A character representing the upper bound of the character range
  * \param key The encryption key
  * \param plain_text A null-terminated string containing the plaintext to be encrypted
  * \param cipher_text A pointer to a buffer where the encrypted text will be stored. The
  *           buffer must be large enough to hold a C string of the same length as
  *           plain_text (including the terminating null character).
  *
  * \pre `plain_text` must be a valid null-terminated C string
  * \pre `cipher_text` must point to a buffer of identical length to `plain_text`
  * \pre `range_high` must be strictly greater than `range_low`.
  * \pre `key` must fall within range from 0 to `(range_high - range_low)`, inclusive.
